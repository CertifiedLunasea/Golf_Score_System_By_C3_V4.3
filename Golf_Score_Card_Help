GOLF SCORE CARD HELP

This is an automatic golf score card that works with the >(O.o)< and ((C.C.)) golf club Systems as well as the >(O.o)< Disc Golf system on automatic however you can use it manually if needed using the menu.
Every time you hit a ball, swing your club, or throw a disc 1 stroke will be added to your score for that hole.
Once you sink the ball into a hole, or place the disc in the basket that hole/basket is finalized and the score starts at the next hole/basket.
Courses may set penalty amounts differently so check the course rules to make sure you are familiar with them.
Some regions are better than others regarding chat lag. If you do get chat lag you'll need to give the card more time to be ready or process score data.
In some cases regions that experience chat lag may also fail to send scores to Golf Score Servers. If you experience this contact the course owner.
