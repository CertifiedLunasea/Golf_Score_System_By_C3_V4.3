# Golf Hole by C3
# NOTE: Lines that are blank or star with # are not used by the script.
# The object, time, and range settings are in name=value pairs.
# The name of the setting occurs to the left of the = sign in each pair.
# You will set the value of each setting on the right of the = sign in each pair.
# Potential positions are set by entering a coordinate vector on a line by itself.
# A maximum of 20 potential positions can be entered.
# NOTE: This notecard is optional for regular golf if holes do not need to move.
# IMPORTANT: This notecard is required for disc golf baskets and for the hole/basket movement feature to work.

# GOLF GAME OBJECT (REQUIRED FOR DISC GOLF)
# This setting dictates if the hole is used for regular golf or disc golf.
# Set this to one of "disc", "golf disc", "golfdisc", "disc golf" or "discgold" for it to operate as a Disc Golf Basket.
# NOTE: This setting must be set to one of the above values for disc golf baskets to work.
# Any other setting, leaving the setting blank, or omitting the setting will cause it to operate as a regular Golf Hole.
# The default operation is as a regular Golf Hole.
object = 

# TIME BETWEEN POSITION CHANGES (OPTIONAL)
# Time must be set in minutes and can use fractions of a minute (decimals).
# Setting time to 0 or leaving it blank will disable the automatic movement of the hole.
# Time must be set no lower than 10 to work.
# Time must be set no higher than 43200 to work.
# NOTE: 43200 minutes is exactly 30 days.
# Any non-zero and non-blank setting below 10 will be treated as 10 minutes.
# Any setting above 43200 will be treated as 43200 minutes (30 days).
time = 

# NEARBY AVATAR RANGE (OPTIONAL)
# The holes will delay movement if any avatar is found within a set range.
# The range setting allows you to set that range.
# The range setting must be set in meters from the center of the hole object.
# The range setting must be set no lower than 5 to work.
# The range setting must be set no higher than 30 to work.
# Any setting below 5 will be treated as 5 meters.
# Any setting above 30 will be treated as 30 meters.
# Leaving this setting blank will use the default value of 15 meters.
range = 

# POTENTIAL POSITIONS LIST (OPTIONAL)
# Potential position settings consist only of vector values.
# Only supply the vector value and nothing else.
# Potential positions are set without a setting name or = character on the line.
# All Potential position settings must be in vector format.
# All potential positions must be on their own line.
# Vector X and Y values must be greater than 0.
# Vector X and Y values must also be less than 255.
# Vector Z values must be set to altitudes above region water level.
# Vector Z values must be set to altitudes lower than 4096 (build limit).
# Only the first 20 unique positions will be utilized.
# Positions beyond the first 20 unique positions are discarded.
